## Include Competitor Angle

When your brand has competitors defined, briefs automatically include positioning:

```
DIFFERENTIATION ANGLE:

- Focus on startup-specific features
```

## Brief Components

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|

| Featured snippet | Position 0 target |
| Internal links | Cross-linking opportunities |

## Tips

**Be specific with keywords.** "hr software" is vague. "hr software for startups under 50 employees" gives better briefs.

**Include intent.** "comparison brief" vs "how-to brief" changes the structure significantly.

**Check brand context.** Run `/brand` first. Briefs use your competitors and positioning.
